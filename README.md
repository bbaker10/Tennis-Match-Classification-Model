# Tennis-Match-Classification Model

The purpose of this project is to showcase my knowledge of preparing data for model testing and applying various statistical algorithms to create an accurate model that would predict the outcome of a Women's Tennis Association, Grand Slam match.

I began with the data found in the three "original_data" csv files. After cleaning missing values, creating univariate and multivariate visualizations, and testing for collinearity and outliers, my group and I created the "clean_data.csv" file.

Once we cleaned the data, I began testing categorical algorithms, starting with Logistic Regression, to determine which variables were statistically significant. I performed additional testing with mutliple random samples to determine which subset of variables would be the most accurate for our prediction.

After additional model testing, we determined our ANN model (with 20 tours) had the best predictive power. We created a predictive experiment in Azure Machine Learning Studio, which can be seen in the final_model_predictive_experiment.xlsx file.
